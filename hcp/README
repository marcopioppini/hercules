hcp: CLI Client for the Hercules Server
=================================================

This tool is intended to simplify interaction with the Hercules server via its API.

Usage: `hcp [OPTIONS]... SRC-API SRC-PATH DST-ADDR DST-PATH`

For example, if you're running this tool on the same machine as the source Hercules server
and want to transfer the file `hercules.in` to `hercules.out`, with the destination
Hercules server listening on `64-2:0:9,192.168.4.2:10000`, run the following command:

`hcp localhost:8000 hercules.in 64-2:0:9,192.168.4.2:10000 hercules.out`

Building
==========
`go build`
