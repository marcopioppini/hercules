Hercules plugin for gfal2
=========================
This plugin adds support for the Hercules file transfer tool to gfal2 (and FTS).
The plugin will handle transfers with URLs of the following form:
hercules://hercules_monitor/path/to/file
where `hercules_monitor` is the address and port of the Hercules monitor.


To build this plugin, you will need the following dependencies:
- gfal2
- libcurl

To build, type `make`.
To install the plugin, type `make install`. By default, this will install the
plugin, documentation and configuration to `/usr/local`. Depending on your FTS
installation, you may need to use `PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc make install`.
